# Medicare-Hospital-Spending-by-Claim

<h3> Description </h3>
The data describes average spending levels during hospitalsâ€™ Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) episodes by Medicare claim type. The data presented on Hospital Compare provide price-standardized, non-risk-adjusted values for hospital spending by claim type because risk adjustment is done at the episode level rather than at the service category/claim level. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to an inpatient hospital admission through 30 days after discharge.
